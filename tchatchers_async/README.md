## Project Overview
This project is an asynchronous crate designed to handle queued messages in Redis.

## Tool Description and Usage
The crate provides functionality to process queued messages asynchronously using Redis as the messaging system. It allows you to define queues, read and process messages from the queues, and generate reports on the processed messages.

## Usage Notes
To run the tool, ensure that the required dependencies, such as the database and Redis messaging system, are set up and running properly.

## Project Structure
The project has the following structure:


```bash
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── config.rs
    ├── conf.yml
    └── main.rs
```

- `Cargo.toml`: The configuration file for Rust's package manager, Cargo.
- `src/config.rs`: The module containing configuration-related logic.
- `src/conf.yml`: The configuration file for the project, where you can define queue settings and other parameters.
- `src/main.rs`: The main entry point of the crate, where the execution of the tool starts.
